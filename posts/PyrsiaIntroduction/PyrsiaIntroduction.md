If you prefer you can read this blog post on Medium [here](TODO).

From the experts of binary management, [JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com), comes [Pyrsia](https://pyrsia.io). [Pyrsia](https://pyrsia.io) is a solution to the open source software supply chain like nothing you've seen before. You can read a little about it [here](https://github.com/pyrsia), [here](https://jfrog.com/blog/pyrsia-open-source-software-that-helps-protect-the-open-source-supply-chain/) and [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220525005671/en/JFrog-Ushers-in-New-Era-of-Open-Source-Software-Security-Launching-Project-Pyrsia-to-Help-Prevent-Software-Supply-Chain-Attacks).

My high level synopsis is it's crazy we install open source software from builds that are not verified. Sure it's convenient but you might as well leave your front door open. Better yet, go pickup a bunch of unsavories and bring them home for lunch, then go on vacation.

[Pyrsia](https://pyrsia.io) is a work in progress but solves all of this. Everything starts somewhere and ground zero is here and now. Trusted entities run a Pyrsia node that builds the source and everything lives in a blockchain. This is not a blockchain to make wealth or that will use up all the plents power plants to mine coins, this blockchain has a purpose. The source to binary transition (software supply chain) hashes are all verified and authenticated so when you download something you know a binary was built from a specific source. Take this a step further, any security audit done will be given back to the community so big or small companies will benefit and the entire sofware supply chain is much better off.

This is a war to protect all CPU cycles against bad actors. I guarentee we are all running trojan horses in packages or libraries we've installed via some package manager at one point or another. It's impossible to protect against. [Pyrsia](https://pyrsia.io) solves this.
