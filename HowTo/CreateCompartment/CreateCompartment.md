## Create a Oracle Cloud Compartment

By Chris Bensen

If you prefer you can read this blog post on GitHub [here](TODO).


A [Compartment](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm) is useful when you want to organize and isolate your cloud resources. This is the same reason you have boxes and drawers at home or carry things around in a backpack.

This requires an Oracle Cloud account. You can get one for free called the [Free Tier Account](TODO).

1. Click the menu icon in the upper left corner.

1. Scroll to the bottom, under Identity, click "Compartments" (or in the search type Compartments)
