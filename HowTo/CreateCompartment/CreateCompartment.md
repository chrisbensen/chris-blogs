If you prefer you can read this blog post on GitHub [here](https://github.com/chrisbensen/chris-blogs/blob/main/HowTo/CreateCompartment/CreateCompartment.md).


A [Compartment](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm) is useful when you want to organize and isolate your cloud resources. This is the same reason you have boxes and drawers at home or carry things around in a backpack. Think of it like a Folder on your computer's file system.

This requires an Oracle Cloud account. You can get one for free called the [Free Tier Account](https://medium.com/oracledevs/create-an-oracle-always-free-cloud-account-bc6aa82c1397).

1. Click the menu icon in the upper left corner.

1. Scroll to the bottom, under Identity, click "Compartments" (or in the search type Compartments):
